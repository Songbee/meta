Songbee Meta
=============

Songbee will be a post-cloud music streaming app, similar to [Spotify](http://spotify.com) or [Deezer](http://deezer.com). The key difference is: *it's free and decentralized*, powered by peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent.

This is a meta-repository. It'll contain a TODO-list (currently at #1) and some project-wide issues discussed here. If you'd like to see some actual code (and are brave enough!), try these:

* [peerez-app](https://github.com/Songbee/peerez-app)
* [peerez-framework](https://github.com/Songbee/peerez-framework)
